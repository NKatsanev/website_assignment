description: I have studied Banking and Financial Management at the University of Piraeus in Greece where I have lived most of my life. For the past 9 months I completed my mandatory service to the Greek army and currently I am part of the Masters in Financial Analysis cohort at London Business School. I have done two internships in IB at Alantra, particularly in the NPL portfolio sales sector. During my time at the firm, I was assigned to both sell and buy side projects with Greek and International clients. Using my experience at Alantra, I co-founded my universityâ€™s Finance Club and served as vice-president, with a goal to provide a link between the job market and academia. I also represented my university and eventually Greece at the CFA Global Research Challenge where we won nationally and went on to become the first and only Greek team to ever reach the EMEA finals. Combining my experience at Alantra and the valuation project of the CFA challenge, I am certain that I want to pursue IB post graduation. Finally aside from my professional endeavours, I play music. I am the lead singer and guitarist in a rock band.
